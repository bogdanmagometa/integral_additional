# Lab work 2: Parallelization of evaluation of integral of a given function with CUDA
Author: <a href="https://github.com/bogdanmagometa">Bohdan Mahometa</a><br>
Variant: 4 (Langermann function)

## Prerequisites

The following tools need to be available in order to use the project:
- GCC
- Cmake and Make
- Boost library (Boost::program_options Boost::system are used in the project)
- CUDA
- Python 3 (if you want to use scripts)
- `numpy`, `matplotlib` and `mplcyberpunk` Python packages if you want to run `plotter.py`

### Compilation (Linux)

In order to get an executable of the program calculating integral, execute the following in the 
project's root directory.
```bash
$ CUDACXX=nvcc ./compile.sh -d -O -R
```

<b>Note:</b> The last command places the executable inside `./bin` directory

<b>Note:</b> You can replace `nvcc` with path to your CUDA compiler.

<b>Note:</b> There are warnings during compilation.

### Usage (Linux)

#### Running the compiled program once

To execute the compiled program once, run the following command in the project's root
directory:
```bash
$ ./bin/integrate_task_4 <path-to-configuration-file>
4
-1.60464695758
2.94818379043e-07
1.83727843363e-07
12221227
```
Argument ```<path-to-configuration-file>``` is optional (defaults to ./data/config_file.cfg).

The content of ```<path-to-configuration-file>``` should be in TOML format with exactly the following
set of specified arguments:
- abs_err - desired absolute error
- rel_err - desired relative error
- x_start - left bound of integration along x axis
- x_end - right bound of integration along x axis
- y_start - lower bound of integration along y axis
- y_end - upper bound of integration along y axis
- init_steps_x - number of point in initial partition along x axis
- init_steps_y - number of point in initial partition along y axis
- max_iter - maximum number of iterations

See example of configuration file in ```data/``` directory

The program outputs the following information in the following order:
- number of variant (4)
- calculated value of integral
- absolute error (isn't real absolute value, only estimation)
- relative error (isn't real relative value, only estimation)
- time spent calculating the integral (in microseconds)

#### Running the program several times
You can run the executable several times and find minimum time of execution among all runs. To this end,
run the following in the project's root directory:
```bash
$ python3 runner.py <number-of-runs>
13162516
```

The ```runner.py``` script creates temporary configuration file with values specified in the 
source code of ```runner.py``` and passes it to the executable. Path to the
executable is also specified in the source code of ```runner.py```.

The script prints out the minimum execution time among all runs (in microseconds).

### Important!
The specification of the laptop on which the integration was executed:
1. CPU: AMD; Ryzen 5 4600H; 3.0 GHz; 6 cores; 12 threads
2. RAM: 16 Gb; DDR4; 3200 MHz
3. storage: 512 GB SSD
4. GeForce GTX 1050 3 GB Max-Q

### Results

I ran the executable 5 times with the following configuration file. The minimum time 
of execution among all runs was `4.974` seconds.
```text
abs_err = 0.0000005
rel_err = 0.00002
x_start = -10
x_end = 10
y_start = -10
y_end = 10
init_steps_x = 100
init_steps_y = 100
max_iter = 10
```
